"],["introduction.html", "1 Introduction", " 1 Introduction In November 2016, the US presidential election results came out as a shattering surprise to voters across the country. In many states, the standoff between the final two candidates, businessman Donald J. Trump and former Secretary of State Hillary R. Clinton, reversed at the last minute and went beyond major media’s predictions (Barbaro 2016). Despite the fact that Clinton and the Democratic Party won by popular votes, the majority of the Electoral College votes went to Trump and the Republican Party, and thus, allowed Trump to assume the presidency. Even though the Democratic Party lost the election in 2016, over time, the Party is improving in some states, including Texas, which typically is a strong foothold for the Republican Party. The Lone Star State voted Republican for every presidential election, regardless of the national voter turnout, since President Reagan in 1980. Yet, the Democratic Party is gaining its ground in Texas over the years. Texas was one of the eleven states where Clinton improved on President Obama’s reelection in 2012, and Clinton lost Texas by a smaller margin than any Democrat since 1996 (270toWin, n.d.). The change we observed in the 2016 Election could potentially be attributed to different factors. For one, diversity in Texas has been changing over the years. Texas has been a popular gateway for Mexican immigrants in to the US due to its geographic proximity. Since 1980, the number of Mexican immigrants in Texas has been in a constant increase. Also, the economic status of residents in Texas has also been changing. Historically, Texas has been a state that relied on farming and natural resources like timber and oil (Reavis 2004). After World War II, new technologies and industries changed Texas’ economic infrastructure. Understanding how these factors played out in the 2016 election helps us understand the political dynamics of Texas, and will help us better predict election results in the coming years. Therefore, our focus for this project turns to how different demographic and economic factors played a role in the 2016 election results. References "],["data.html", "2 Data", " 2 Data Here, we introduce the data sets we used to conduct this analysis. Because election results does not cover the demographic or economic factors that we will use, we need to join several data sets together to create the analysis and the visualizations that we might need. Our main data set that contains all of the counties in Texas, their voting statistics and the amount of votes each candidate received from each county came from the US Census. Once we downloaded this data, we cleaned the data by removing unnecessary variables that did not have any impact on voting results and changed the county names so that they were in an identical style. This was our principle data set that we joined all of the following data sets to. The next, is our data set that included voter registration figures from 2016, gathered from Texas Secretary of State, and we combined that with our TX data set. After that, we included data that had the population estimates from 2016 based off of data from the TDC - Texas Demographic Center. We also combined this with our main TX data to show the proportion of registered voters as well as the proportion of actual voters from registration. Next, we added two data sets that included 2016 demographic data by county and 2016 income data, both by county and both of these data sets came from the Census. The Demographics data included the amount of people that were of a certain race or ethnicity and the number of people in each county that were foreign-born. The income data included only the average per-capita income of each county and we combined both of these data sets to the main TX data set. Lastly, we include two data sets that we use for visualizing, which includes the spatial county map of Texas, gathered from the Tidycensus package in R, and data that adds the major cities in Texas, whose coordinated we acquired from Google Maps, to get a better understanding of where major city centers are located in Texas. "],["visualizations.html", "3 Visualizations", " 3 Visualizations The first visualization we wanted to look at from our data was to see which candidates won each of the different counties in Texas and the margin of victory held in each county. As you can see, many of the counties voted in favor of Republican Donald Trump, which is not a surprise seeing that Texas as a state has leaned Republican in every Presidential election since 1976 when Jimmy Carter won there. However, what we do notice is that around metropolitan/city centers, more people voted for Clinton, but more surprisingly, many along the Texas-Mexico border also voted in favor of Hillary Clinton. These counties became a focus for us as we began to look deeper into the results of the election. (Also there are counties on these maps that are white and that is because these counties did not have enough data in the census for us to include them in our analysis.) Next, we wanted to look at demographic data across Texas so that we can gain more of an understanding of where certain demographics are located within the state. These maps give a very stark representation into where the two predominant race/ethnicities, White and Hispanic, are located in Texas. The further Southwest or closer the counties are to the Mexican border, we see a higher proportion of voters that are Hispanic and the farther Northeast or farther away from the border, we see a higher proportion of white voters. While this may make a lot of sense, I want you to keep this in mind as we look at our next visualization set. Texas is notoriously bad at getting its registered voters to actually get to the voting booth and is consistently ranked as one of the worst states at getting voters to turnout in national elections. So, in this visualization, we analyzed how far away each county is from the national average of 60% Statista. In this visualization, the counties that are in green are above the national average in voter turnout, counties in white at the national average and counties in red are below the national average. Counties that are more red are farther below the national average and the counties that are the most red along the Texas-Mexican border, which has a higher majority of Hispanic voters. "],["analysis.html", "4 Analysis 4.1 Linearity 4.2 Neighborhood Structure 4.3 Interpretation 4.4 Residuals", " 4 Analysis As we begin the analysis portion or our project, we asked ourselves, what factors always have influence in national elections? Of course, the amount of people that are registered and the amount of people that go to the polls that are registered play a big part. We also wanted to compare across major ethnicities in Texas, rural vs. urban, and income disparity in the state. We felt that these three factors in addition to registration and turnout would allow us to be able to get a good cross-section of the 2016 election in Texas. 4.1 Linearity The first part of our modeling process was to look at a linear model with our variables to see what the residuals would look like and to test if all of our variables have linearity. The variable that we are attempting to model results around is the vote difference which is a variable that is on a scale from -1 to 1, 1 being a county voted 100% for Trump and -1 being 100% voted for Clinton. The variables that we used to try and predict the vote difference are the proportion of Hispanic, White, Black and Foreign-born voters, the voter turnout deficit, and each county’s per-capita income. After producing our preliminary linear model and residual map, we found that not every variable had a linear pattern against vote difference (see above). Three of them (deficit, foreign-born and per-capita income) had a quadratic relationship against the vote difference. As a result, we split those three variables into splines so that within each section, the relationship is linearly correlated to the vote difference. For example, we split per-capita income into “income_hi” and “income_low” where the split occurs at 40000 and both variables are now linear. However, when we did a linear model including the split variables, we saw that there was very little change in the residual maps, leading us to believe that there was more work to be done to explain the spatial relationships between the counties. 4.2 Neighborhood Structure The next step is to figure out which type of neighbors we want and what type of spatial model we want to use. What we mean by different types of neighbors in this context, is figuring out how we want to evaluate how related each county is to one another. There are three possible neighborhood structures that we can use. A Queen neighborhood structure will see two counties as neighbors if they share at least one point on their boundaries. A Rook neighborhood structure is more selective and will see two counties as neighbors only if they share a line boundary. The Bishop neighborhood structure (displayed below) does not apply to our analysis, so we will not include it in our future modeling processes. Three neighborhood structures The different types of spatial models are also important to understand as we look at SAR and CAR models. A CAR model (Conditional Auto-Regressive model) is used for more local relationships and works more toward depth with a smaller number of spaces, whereas a SAR model (Simultaneous Auto-Regressive model) is used more in global relationships and has more to do with breadth across large number of spaces. Using these two pairs of components, we created four models as such: the Queen SAR, Queen CAR, Rook SAR and Rook CAR. When building these models, the main things that we looked at to test their efficacy were the p-values of each variable and the BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion) that gives a unit-less number to determine the quality of each model. Of these 4 models, the worst was the Queen CAR model as the BIC was far too high and the variable p-values did not produce accurate numbers. The remaining three models were all very close in terms of BIC with the lowest (the best) being the Queen SAR and the variable p-values were all very similar as well so we had to look at what is called a Moran’s I test. In a Moran’s I test, we are looking for the highest p-value for independence and a statistic around zero. The Rook CAR model was the worst of the three as the p-value was below .05, and the statistic was about -.19 which indicates the model is not independent and there is still unexplained spatial correlation. The Rook SAR model is better as the p-value is at .09 above the .05 threshold and the statistic is -.06 which is fairly close to zero. However, the Queen SAR model is the best as its p-value is well above ,05 at .3142 and the statistic is -.043, the closest to zero of all our Moran’s I tests on the models. As a result, we ended up selecting the Queen SAR model to model our data. 4.3 Interpretation 4.3.1 Intercept Now that we have chosen the Queen SAR model to be what we model after, we can start to look more closely at how to interpret the results that we have produced. The output for our Queen SAR Model is very interesting because the intercept is -1.35 for vote difference and the scale for this variable is -1 to 1. This may seem like an error, but this is assuming that a county has 0% white, hispanic, black or foreign-born population and the people who live in this county have high income and low voter turnout deficit. All of this to say, this is an impossible county so the intercept is given an impossible number, but it helps us figure out how each variable we look at affects the intercept for each county. 4.3.2 Deficit The first variable in our output is the deficit_hi variable and its estimate value is -.029 with a standard error of .0209. Importantly, this is the only variable in our output that has a p-value above .05 and that means that this variable may not be as good of a response variable as the other variables because it is not statistically significant. However, we can still learn a lot from this. According to our output, if a county has a “high voter turnout deficit,” we can assume that they will vote democratically by .029 percentage points compared to the intercept. This is interesting because our intercept is already so democratic (-1.35) any variable that is negative in the output is very likely going to reflect that that variable leads to democratic voting. In fact, every variable that we look at after is positive, but that is because of the intercept starting as negative as it does. 4.3.3 Hispanic The second variable we look at is the Hispanic variable and its estimate value is 1.335 with a standard error of .326. This variable was calculated as a proportion to the rest of the population, so if you take the proportion of Hispanic people in a county and multiply it by the estimate value and add it to the intercept you would get an estimate for how that county would vote based on Hispanic population. In fact, this is the same for every variable that we look at that involves a percentage of the population. One more important thing to note about this variable is that it has a very low p-value, telling us that this is statistically significant and is informative of the vote difference in any given county. 4.3.4 White Our next variable that we looked at is the proportion of White people in each county, its estimate value is 2.37 with a standard error of .339. Just like the Hispanic variable, the White variable is based on its proportion to the population and can be calculated in the same way we calculated the vote difference based on the Hispanic population. However, the White variable is significantly higher and seeing the vote difference results of some panhandle counties with mostly white populations, it would make sense that the variable is so high. Also similar to the Hispanic variable, the p-value is very low and therefore statistically significant. 4.3.5 Black Much like the first two variables, the Black variable is a proportion as well and its estimate value is .876 and its standard error is .419. In Texas, there is not a significant Black population compared to White and Hispanic populations, but it is still important to include them considering their impact on elections. Even though their estimate is positive, Counites with a higher Black population in Texas tend to vote more democratic than counties with high White and high Hispanic populations because their estimate is lower than both of those variables. The p-value for the Black variable is significantly low as well. 4.3.6 Foreign-born Our last variable based on the proportion of the population is the Foreign-born variable, its estimate is .052 and its standard error is .023. In most counties in Texas, the foreign-born population makes up less than 10% of the population and in some cases foreign born immigrants are not granted voting rights until they are fully fledged citizens. However, we felt it was important to include them as not the foriegn-born population in Texas continues to rise each year. Per the estimate, counties with higher foreign-born populations tend to vote more democratically. That means that counties with higher rates of foreign-born and minority citizens, will likely vote more democratically. The p-value was also low for this variable and thus statistically significant. 4.3.7 Per-capita Income Lastly, we look at income and the estimate .062 with a standard error of .0216. The way that this variable was created was by making a binary for each county based on if the per-capita income was above or below $40,000. The variable we selected for this model was the low income, meaning that if a county’s per-capita income is below 40,000 they county will vote .062 percentage points towards Republicans. Like most of the variables above, even though they are positive, it does not mean that they vote more Republican, because of the intercept being so negative, a small increase likely means that it is more democratic. The p-value for this variable is low and statistically significant as well. 4.4 Residuals txwinning %&gt;% st_make_valid() %&gt;% ggplot() + geom_sf(aes(fill = lm_resid), color = &quot;grey&quot;) + scale_fill_gradient2(mid = &quot;white&quot;, high = &quot;red&quot;, low = &quot;blue&quot;) + theme_classic() + geom_sf_text(data = majorcities%&gt;% filter(!(city == &#39;Fort Worth&#39;)), mapping = aes(label = city), color = &quot;black&quot;) + labs(title = &quot;Linear Model Residuals for Vote Difference in Texas&quot;, fill = &quot;Residuals&quot;) + theme(axis.line = element_blank(), axis.text = element_blank(), axis.ticks = element_blank()) ## Warning in st_point_on_surface.sfc(sf::st_zm(x)): st_point_on_surface may not give correct results for longitude/ ## latitude data txwinning %&gt;% ggplot() + geom_sf(aes(fill = q_mod_sar_resid), color = &quot;grey&quot;) + scale_fill_gradient2(mid = &quot;white&quot;, high = &quot;red&quot;, low = &quot;blue&quot;,labels = scales::comma) + theme_classic() + geom_sf_text(data = majorcities%&gt;% filter(!(city == &#39;Fort Worth&#39;)), mapping = aes(label = city), color = &quot;black&quot;) + labs(title = &quot;Queen SAR Model Residuals for Vote Difference in Texas&quot;, fill = &quot;Residuals&quot;) + theme_classic() + theme(axis.line = element_blank(), axis.text = element_blank(), axis.ticks = element_blank(), axis.title = element_blank()) ## Warning in st_point_on_surface.sfc(sf::st_zm(x)): st_point_on_surface may not give correct results for longitude/ ## latitude data Here, we have our final residual map based on our Queen SAR Model. We are comparing it to our original linear model which has much more drastic residuals as well as some visible patterns which are ironed out in the Queen SAR map. We can see that in our model we have explained much of the larger outliers compared to the linear model’s map and the counties are much more evenly distributed in terms of red and blue counties. There are some interesting things that we still notice from our map though, one of them is the very high residual in Travis county where Austin is located. This means that even after adjusting for our model, the vote difference in Austin is still very high for democrats and that is something our model cannot explain. There is similar high blue residuals in El Paso and Dallas and I wonder if we had added a variable that took into account if a county contained a “large city” we could have tempered those outliers. "],["conclusion.html", "5 Conclusion", " 5 Conclusion Throughout our study of Texas’ county voting habits in the 2016 Presidential Election, we have drawn three main conclusions from our analysis. The first is that counties along the Texas-Mexico border have an undersized influence because they have the lowest voter turnout rates in the state. Coincidentally, these counties also have the highest rates of Hispanic and foreign-born people which minimizes the impact of these voices when voting in Texas. While we are only analyzing this at the Presidential level, this could also be assumed in midterm and state-wide elections as well. Since these counties voted democratically, counter to the rest of the state, it could be reasonably deduced that these counties do not have as strong get out the vote initiatives compared to the rest of the state. Second, counties with high voter turnout deficit, high foreign-born rates and low-income tend to vote more democratically in Texas. These variables have the lowest estimates in our Queen SAR and estimates that are below the intercept (-1.35) tend to mean that they will vote democratically. All three of these variables are below .062 which shows that they would have little impact on the large negative (democratic) intercept. Third if a county has more than a 70% white population, it is almost certain that that county will vote Republican. We derived this by looking at the white estimate which is 2.37. If we take this estimate and multiply it by .7 to stand for 70% of the population being white, we end up with 1.659, which is a full standard error larger than the estimate. This means that if a Texas county has over a 70% White population, it is almost certain that they voted for the Republican candidate in 2016. "],["limitations.html", "6 Limitations", " 6 Limitations Some of the limitations that we encountered during our analysis was not having access to all of the data we wanted. For example, we were missing key data, such as voter registration stats, for five counties and as a result, we just could not use them in our analysis. Also, because the county-level data for 2020’s presidential election is not available yet, we ended up choosing the 2016 election, which results in inaccuracies in some data. This is due to the fact that county-level census data is only available every 10 years (ex. 2010 or 2020). When we are using census data, we would have to choose data that is not 2016, just because of this unavailability. If we had more time, I think we would have looked at more variables beyond demographics and income to try and get a deeper understanding for votes in Texas. I also think if this could be done in another time in the future, we could have looked at the 2020 election and done a comparison between the two elections in Texas to see what changed and possibly why those changes occurred.
